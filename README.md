# Solving the Travelling Salesman problem using Simulated Annealing

In this repository we implement a [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) solver for the Travelling Salesman problem in Python. We then compare various heuristics for choosing the initial starting point and plot the identified routes.
